<p style="background-color:LightGray;">This summer I lived in LA for an internship at a showroom in the Fashion District, called Seamless Showroom. My 3 best friends and I packed up my car and started our trip across the US. It took us a total of 36 hours to get there. We stopped at multiple attractions on the way, with it taking us a total of 5 days comfortably to get there. Upon our arrival we finally get to see our little humble abode. It was a small studio style home in a nice neighborhood in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. Keep in mind that there were 4 of us and 1 bedroom. It was definitely not the most comfortable situation, but none of us cared because we were going to be living in LA for 3 months and that's all that mattered.</p>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;">After 2 weeks of getting to explore LA, we started our internships. All of us were so nervous, as we drank our morning coffee and listened to our favorite music on the way to work. I dropped everyone off and was the last to go in. Parking is by far the hardest thing to find in downtown la, but luckily I was provided with a parking pass in the fashion district that made it super easy for me. After stressing about parking, I walk in the doors and finally meet the people I've been longing to meet. Their names were Hannah, Brooke, Jamie and Chris. Of course things are going to be a little awkward at first but it didn't take long for me to feel like I was a part of their team. We just clicked and worked so well together. My internship wasn't paid, but I didn't care because of the experience. They made me feel right at home, gave me free sample clothing, and took me to Vegas for the Magic Tradeshow. I grew tremendously as a person and career wise.</p>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;">I'm going to carry the experience with me for a lifetime and use it to my full advantage. I can't wait to see where the future leads and the opportunities that will rise. </p>
